I recently started working with something akin to what I would call a "360
hemispherical camera"

Simply put, it's a camera mounted on 2 motors:

- Yaw (or x) from 0 to 360 degrees horizontal
- Pitch (or y) from 0 to 90 degrees vertical (it's a bit more complicated than that, we'll get to it later)

This camera exposes an API to control the axes, get the current orientation
of the camera, and get the live camera feed. What I would like to do next is
build some kind of UI to control this camera.
